Multiple protocols are available for ZooMS that involve differing degrees of invasive sampling and destructive analysis, as well as specialized protocols for alternative enzyme digestions. Below are open access protocols available on the online protocol repository <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a>. When citing protocols, please also cite the original publication from which the open-access protocol was developed. 

<h3>Collection: <a href="">Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS)- Pretreatment protocols for bone material</a></h3>

- <b>Protocol: <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/zooarchaeology-by-mass-spectrometry-zooms-for-bone-dm6gpr255vzp/v1">Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) for bone material - AmBiC protocol</a></b> The AmBic protocol can be used on samples where destructive analysis cannot be undertaken. Samples are pretreated by soaking in ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature followed by a brief heating step to melt a small amount of collagen out of the bone. This protocol is best suited for well preserved remains with good collagen preservation. This method is more likely to fail than the acid based methods as collegen preservation decreases.
- <b>Protocol: <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/zooarchaeology-by-mass-spectrometry-zooms-for-bone-q26g7b9j3lwz/v1">Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) for bone material - Acid insoluble protocol</a></b> This protocol utilizes hydrochloric acid and is destructive. It is suitable for a wide range of preservation conditions from very good to poor preservation. It can be applied to very small sample sizes. This the main protocol used for ZooMS.
- <b>Protocol: <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/zooarchaeology-by-mass-spectrometry-zooms-for-bone-n2bvjybmwvk5/v1">Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) for bone material - Acid soluble protocol</a></b> This protocol utilizes hydrochloric acid and is destructive. It is suitable for a wide range of preservation conditions from very good to poor preservation. It works in cases where the bone is too fragile or the preservation is too poor for successful collagen extraction using the acid insoluble protocol.
