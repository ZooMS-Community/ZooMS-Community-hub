<h2>Welcome to ZooMS!</h2>
This page is for people who are new to ZooMS and would like assistance getting started. Before beginning, there are several primers and reviews available that explain the basic principles of ZooMS. We recommend reading these before proceeding further:

- Richter KK, Codlin MC, Seabrook M, Warinner C. 2022. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2109323119">A primer for ZooMS applications in archaeology</a>. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 119(20):e2109323119.
- Buckley M. 2018. “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64763-0_12">Zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) collagen fingerprinting for the species identification of archaeological bone fragments</a>” in Zooarchaeology in Practice: Case Studies in Methodology and Interpretation in Archaeofaunal Analysis, edited by Giovas CM and LeFebvre MJ. Springer International Publishing, pp. 227–247.

<h2>Collagen</h2>
ZooMS focuses on the peptide mass fingerprinting of type I collagen (COL1), a triple helical protein found in a wide variety of animal tissues. In mammals, the COL1 triple helix is made up of two COL1A1 proteins and one COL1A2 protein. The composition of the COL1 triple helix is more complex in birds and fish. In some teleost fish, the COL1 protein is made up of COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL1A3. 



<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
Several different systems of nomenclature have been used to refer to specific collagen peptides in the ZooMS literature. This can be confusing for beginners. These include those based on lettering systems (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.4316">Buckley et al. 2009</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.08.021">Buckley et al. 2014</a>), tryptic position (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.105116">Richter et al. 2020</a>), and peptide amino acid position (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.104041">Brown et al. 2021</a>). We recommend using the system of nomenclature based on peptide amino acid position because it can be applied consistenly and systematically across animal taxa. For further information about changes in nomenclature through time and for advice on interconverting between systems, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.104041">Brown et al. 2021</a>.
