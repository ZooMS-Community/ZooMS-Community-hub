The predominant software used for ZooMS analysis is the free and open source software <b>mMass</b> (<a href="http://www.mmass.org/download/">http://www.mMass.org</a>). Although the software can still be downloaded, it is unfortunately no longer being developed or supported. 

Recently, efforts have been made to keep mMass available and compatible with new computer operating systems (through the European Research Council FINDER project; https://github.com/dreamingspires/), but additional community support is needed. In addition, most species identifications, even for high- throughput screening, are not automated. Several different methods of automation are currently being explored (135, 136) but still remain in development.
