<h3>mMass</h3>
The predominant software used for ZooMS analysis is the free and open source software <b>mMass</b>. Although the software can still be downloaded, it is unfortunately no longer being developed or supported. Recently, efforts have been made to keep mMass available and compatible with new computer operating systems (through the European Research Council FINDER project), but additional community support is needed.

<h3>Bacollite</h3>
The bacollite package offers a set of tools for aligning MALDI spectrum data with 'theroretical' peak positions that have been calculated from sequence and chemistry data. The alignment is carried out by cross-corelation and yields a correlation score and a lag score, both of which can be used to determine the presence or absence of a peptide in the spectrum.
