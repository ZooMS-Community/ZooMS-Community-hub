Zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry, or ZooMS, is a powerful application of collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) first developed at the University of York (Buckley et al. 2009; Collins et al. 2010). Based on the measurement of tryptic collagen peptides using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF), it leverages the high abundance and long-term preservation of collagen proteins in bone and other animal tissues with the analytical power of mass spectrometry in order to provide robust taxonomic identifications using minimally destructive methods. Since 2009, ZooMS has been used for diverse applications in archaeology and and cultural heritage, ecology and conservation, and paleontology. The key features of ZooMS that have led to its rapid expansion are its relatively low analytical cost per sample compared to other biomolecular identification methods and its low sample input requirements for taxonomic identification. This allows for large scale taxonomic investigations that can augment morphological analyses of faunal remains, as well as provide taxonomic clarity for animal remains or products lacking diagnostic features, as is common for worked bone artifacts and cultural heritage objects.
